This will be the top level part of the documentation and will.
It can be used to write common parts and to define variables that will be accessible to all the submodules.

This sample project is composed of three modules:

  * distribution 
  * module1
  * module2
  
The first one is the one that will be in charge of producing the asciidoc output, the other two modules are there 
just to demonstrate how to create a multimodule asciidoc document.

All the submodules can be included as if they were local with something like:

[source,asciidoc]
.mydocument.asciidoc
----
   include::distribution.asciidoc[leveloffset=+1]
   include::module1.asciidoc[leveloffset=+1]
   include::module2.asciidoc[leveloffset=+1]
----

include::distribution.asciidoc[leveloffset=+1]
include::module1.asciidoc[leveloffset=+1]
include::module2.asciidoc[leveloffset=+1]
