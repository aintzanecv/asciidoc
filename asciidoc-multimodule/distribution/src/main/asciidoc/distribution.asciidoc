Distribution module
===================

This is the module where the real asciidoc work will be performed.
The way it works is very simple: an assembly copies all the asciidoc inside a staging directory (asciidoc/staging),
then the asciidoc maven plugin works on those files.

An example assembly descriptor (the one used by this document) could be:

[source,xml,numbered]
.doc.xml
----
include::${root.dir}/distribution/src/assembly/doc.xml[]
----

As you will notice, the file filtering function is enabled: this allows you to use maven variables inside your asciidoc document.

Last thing to do is to configure the pom.xml file inside the distribution module.

[source,xml,numbered]
.pom.xml
----
include::${root.dir}/distribution/pom.xml[]
----

You are done. Enjoi!
