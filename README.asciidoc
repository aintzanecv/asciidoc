# ASCIIDOC on multimodule project

This project wants to be an example of how to use ASCIIDOC to document a multimodule project.
The structure of the project is the following:

   parent
      src/main/asciidoc
      module1
         src/main/asciidoc
      module2
        src/main/asciidoc
      distribution
        src/main/asciidoc
        
module1 and module2 are there only for demonstration purpose, while the *distribution* module is the one that does the real work.

Building the project an HTML file is produced inside 'target/generated-docs' folder of the distribution module.
That document is built by assembling all the ASCIIDOC files found in each module.
